<h1>Help for the Group Torus Image Generator</h1>

This web page allows one to create an image file suitable for group torus meditations.  There are four components to the generated image:
<ul>
	<li>the <b>Group Torus Title</b>,</li>
	<li>the list of <b>Members / Masters</b>,</li>
	<li>the <b>Torus Circle</b>,</li>
	<li>and the optional <b>Recipient</b> name in the center of the torus.</li>
</ul>
Changes to the torus information are immediately reflected in the torus image to the upper right of the page or the top of the page depending on the device's viewport size.  The image can be downloaded at any time by pressing the <span class="navbarExample"><i class="fa fa-fw fa-download"></i> <b>Download</b></span> navigation button.  For convenience, the default name of download image is constructed with the title name and the current date.  Note that this feature may not be available on all platforms (on an iPad the image just appears in a new tab).

<h2>Group Torus Title</h2>
The <b>Group Torus Title</b> consists of three text fields named "<b>Title 1</b>", "<b>Title 2</b>", and "<b>part (optional)</b>".  The contents of these three fields are drawn at the top of the image.  The "<b>Title 1</b>" field is used to automatically create the download filename with the current date appended.  That is, if this field has contents "Group Torus with the Archangels" then the download filename could default to "Group Torus with the Archangels - Jul 5, 2018.png".  The "<b>part (optional)</b>" field is typically left blank.  It can be used if multiple images are necessary with unique part names like "Group A" and "Group B".  The title font style, size, bold/italic/shadow attributes can be changed.  Finally, colours can be selected for the "<b>Title 1</b>"/"<b>Title 2</b>" lines as well as the "<b>part (optional)</b>" line.
<div/><br/>

<h2>Members / Masters</h2>
Initially, 8 members and optional masters can be specified.  Additional rows can be added by pressing the <span id="addRowButtonExample">Add Row</span> button.  Each row is of the form "<b>Member [person] works with [master]</b>" where the master can be selected from a drop down menu.  The first member field that is not blank is considered special in that it is placed in the cardinal direction as specified by the "<b>Orientation for the first member</b>" drop down menu.  All the remaining members/masters are drawn around the torus ring in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise manner depending on the order selected by the drop down menu.  Note that there is no validation for duplicate members or for any master to be present.  The font style and colour for members and masters can be changed.
<div/><br/>

<blockquote class="default">
Hints:
<ul>
  <li>Some browsers may change the cursor when hovering over the Members/Masters list to indicate that rows can be moved.</li>
  <li>Use the TAB key to move between member and master names to speed up input.</li>
  <li>Some browsers may allow the user to start typing in the name of a master from the drop down menu to quickly choose the name.   For instance, typing <b>l</b>-followed-by-<b>o</b> will select "LORD LANTO".  Hitting the ESC key will clear the search pattern.</li>
</blockquote>

Each member row can be moved down the list by pressing the "<b>&#8681;</b>" character at the start of the row.  This can be useful on devices which don't support drag and drop functionality like cell phones and tablets.<div/><br/>

Member rows in the list can be deleted if the member name is non-blank.  In this case, the "<b>Member</b>" row will end with a "<b>&#9949;</b>" character.  Clicking the "<b>&#9949;</b>" character will delete the row and will shift up rows below it.<div/><br/>

Member rows in the torus group can be rearranged by selecting a row of the form "<b>Member [person] works with [master]</b>" and dragging it to a destination row.  Note that you will need to select the textual components of the row (i.e. the "<b>Member</b>" or "<b>works with</b>") and avoid the "<b>&#8681;</b>" and "<b>&#9949;</b>" in order to select the row.  Intermediate rows will be shifted up or down depending on the direction in which the source row is dragged.  Multiple adjacent rows with the same member name (called a 'block') can be rearranged using the following rules:
<ol>
    <li>If the member name of the source and destination rows are the same then the individual rows with the block will be rearranged.</li>
    <li>If the destination row is the start of a block of rows (i.e. the first row of a block of rows with the same member name) then the source block of rows will be moved BEFORE the destination block.</li>
    <li>Otherwise, if the destination row is the repeating member name (i.e. beyond the first row of the block) then source block of rows will be moved AFTER the destination block.</li>
</ol><div/><br/>

It is possible to assign multiple masters to a member by creating adjacent rows with the same member name.  The set of masters are rendered with a "<b>/</b>" character between the master names. 

<h2>Torus Circle</h2>

<p>The image background can be modified by the row entitied "<b>Background</b>".  This row consists of a "<b>colour</b>" to use and a "<b>treatment</b>" drop down menu.  If the treatment type is "None" then the selected colour will solid fill the image background.  Otherwise, the treatment image will be drawn in the background image.  The opacity of the background image can be altered by changing the colour.</p>

The torus is drawn as a circle with overlayed smaller circles called <i>pegs</i> denoting where members are situated.  The torus circle size and width can be changed with the "<b>circle size</b>" and "<b>circle width</b>" drop down menus, respectively.  The circle line treatment can be changed with the "<b>circle line treatment</b>" drop down menu with types
<ul>
  <li>SOLID : draw the circle as a solid regular line</li>
  <li>WAVE : draw the circle as a wavy line</li>
  <li>RIPPLE : draw the circle as two wavy lines superimposed</li>
  <li>RAY: draw short ray lines from the center of the torus</li>
  <li>SPIRAL: draw a looping spiral</li>
</ul>
The "<b>circle treatment</b>" drop down menu offers a few treatment patterns for rendering images within the torus circle.  A few examples are:
<ul>
  <li>HEART : draw a heart shape</li>
  <li>RANDOM : draw a random mandala pattern</li>
  <li>FLOWER_OF_LIFE : draw a flower of life pattern</li>
  <li>METATRONS_CUBE : draw Metatron's cube</li>
  <li>DAISY : draw a daisy flower pattern</li>
  <li>PETALS : draw flower petals</li>
  <li>GOLDEN_SPIRAL : draw random golden spiral pattern</li>
  <li>METATRON_2 : draw a detailed Metatron's cube</li>
  <li>MESH : draw a wire mesh between all member pegs</li>
  <li>GEOMETRIC_1 : draw a wire pattern between all member pegs</li>
  <li>IMAGE : when supported, drag and drop an image</li>
  <li>Picture '<i>PICTURE-NAME</i>' : display a preloaded image in the torus circle</li>
</ul>  
The colour of the torus treatment can be changed with the colour selector immediately following the "<b>circle treatment</b>" drop down menu.   When displaying a <b>Picture</b> in the torus circle, adjusting this colour selector affects the opacity of the image.<div/><br/>
 
<blockquote class="default">
If many members and masters are specified then the generated image can look cluttered as the web page makes its best effort to place the text.  Try adjusting the "<b>circle size</b>" and "<b>Orientation for the first member</b>" values until a pleasing image is generated.
</blockquote>

The size of torus pegs can be changed with the "<b>peg width</b>" drop down menu.  In addition, the shape of the pegs can be changed with the "<b>peg treatment</b>" drop down menu to
<ul>
  <li>Circle</li>
  <li>Square</li>
  <li>Diamond</li>
  <li>Heart</li>
  <li>Star</li>
</ul>
A "<b>Rotate</b>" checkbox beside the "<b>peg treatment</b>", when checked, will cause the drawn peg to be oriented so that the bottom of the checkbox image faces the centre of the torus. 

The internal and border colours of pegs can be changed with the "<b>peg colour</b>" and "<b>peg border colour</b>" selectors.
<div/><br/>

<h2>Recipient (optional)</h2>

The optional "<b>Recipient</b>" field is used to draw text in the center of the torus circle.  Its font and colour selection can be changed.
<div/><br/>

<h2>Customization</h2>
Multiple configurations are supported via bookmarks.  At the bottom of the web page is a "<b>My URL</b>" field that, when requested, will update various selections.  Copy and paste this URL into your bookmark manager for quick reference.<div/><br/>

Since torus images may be created for different days, layout configurations can be saved as profiles.  For example, assume that an event was repeatedly created on Mondays with a specific set of fonts, colours, etc.  Clicking the "<b>Save profile</b>" button (on Monday) will save the layout configuration with the "<b>Title 1</b>" name which will be automatically loaded the next Monday.  A drop down "<b>Profiles</b>" menu can be selected to reload a previously saved layout.
